    <p>I am for the most part a novice in the technological field only touching upon certain disciplines within the field on my own time or within my TIJ1O0 course. I have undertaken small projects in Node.js out of curiosity to automate certain menial tasks with the overarching purpose of learning. The reason why I took this course is to build upon what I’ve learned and gain knowledge regarding programming languages and it’s unique ecosystems as a whole with the purpose of becoming proficient in the field. If the course goes well It would help me decide which pathway I would choose regarding post-secondary education and onwards.

        <h3>Plans For The Future</h3>
        </div>
        <p>In the near future I see myself in a field of Engineering or Computer Science, and build a career in one of these fields. The courses I take in High-School are conducive to further my plans of attending a post-secondary institution and attaining a career, hence why I took this course. I’d like to maintain a high average throughout my final years of high-school, and as I grow older I’d like to start travelling across the world and learn new cultures.
